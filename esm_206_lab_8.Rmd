### 1. One-way ANOVA to compare penguin flipper lengths

![](penguin-heights.jpg)

Read in data, get some counts, etc:

```{r}
penguins <- readr::read_csv("penguins.csv") %>% 
  clean_names()
```

Find some counts based on species and sex:
```{r}
penguin_counts <- penguins %>% 
  count(species, sex)

penguin_counts
```

We're going to ask: Is there a significant difference in mean flipper length for female penguins across the 3 species?

Create a subset that only contains observations for femal penguins, then visually explore the distributions for each species:
```{r}
penguin_f <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "FEMALE")

# Visually explore the distributions of flipper lengths for the three species:

# Histograms:
ggplot(data = penguin_f, aes(x = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~species)

# qq plot: 
ggplot(data = penguin_f, aes(sample = flipper_length_mm)) +
  geom_qq() +
  facet_wrap(~species)

# Look close to normally distributed, all groups n > 30 >>> use parametric one-way ANOVA to compare flipper lengths
```

Find some summary statistics using group_by + summarize

```{r}
penguin_f_summary <- penguin_f %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(
    mean_flipper_length = mean(flipper_length_mm),
    sd_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm),
    sample_size = n(),
    se_flipper_length = sd(flipper_length_mm)/sqrt(n()),
    var_flipper_length = var(flipper_length_mm)
  )
```

Levene's test:
```{r}
leveneTest(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)

# Retain null hypothesis: equal variances
```

Beeswarm plot with mean and standard deviation overlayed:

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_beeswarm(data = penguin_f,
                aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm),
                size = 3,
                alpha = 0.6,
                pch = 16, #pch means point size#
                color = "gray70") +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Adelie", "Chinstrap", "Gentoo")) +
  geom_point(data = penguin_f_summary,
             aes(x = species, y = mean_flipper_length),
             color = "red") +
  geom_errorbar(data = penguin_f_summary,
                aes(x = species,
                    ymin = mean_flipper_length - sd_flipper_length,
                    ymax = mean_flipper_length + sd_flipper_length),
                width = 0.1) +
  theme_light()#if you are plotting an errorbar you are telling R to plot a line that extends to the mean + 1sd to the mean - 1sd#
```

**Figure 1.** *Flipper lengths (mm) for Adelie (n = ), Chinstrap (n =), and Gentoo (n = ) penguins at Palmer Station, Antarctica. Means indicated by black points; error bars indicate $\pm$ 1 standard deviation. Data source:*

```{r}
penguin_aov <- aov(flipper_length_mm ~ species, data = penguin_f)
summary(penguin_aov)

# There IS a significant difference in meean flipper lengths between Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo penguins at Palmer Station (F(2,162) = 411.8, p < 0.0001).

```

...well, if the mean aren't equal, then which ones differ? 
- do a post-hoc test
```{r}
TukeyHSD(penguin_aov)
```

One-way ANOVA with post-hoc Tukey's HSD reveals a significant difference in mean female flipper length between all 3 species (Gentoo, Adelie, Chinstrap) (stats results...).

### Part 2: Tables and proportions and chi-square
```{r}
party_relig <- gss_cat %>% 
  filter(partyid %in% c("Strong republican", "Strong democrat")) %>% 
  filter(relig %in% c ("None", "Catholic")) %>% 
  count(partyid, relig)

party_relig_table <- party_relig %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = relig, values_from = n)

party_relig_table
```

Make a nice table of counts and proportions within each group:
```{r}
party_relig_prop <- party_relig_table %>% 
  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = "row") %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 1) %>% 
  adorn_ns(position = "front")

party_relig_prop

kable(party_relig_prop) %>% 
  kable_styling()
```

Run chi-square test for independence.

First, get only a contingency table (values only; no additional colums)

```{r}
chi_counts <- party_relig_table %>% 
  select(-partyid)

chi_counts
```

A couple ways to ask a question that would prompt chi-square:

- Is there a significant difference in religious affiliation (none/catholic) between strong democrats and strong republicans?

- Is there a significant association between party affiliation (stron dem/strong repub) on religious affiliation (none/catholic)
```{r}
chisq.test(chi_counts)
```

H0: No significant association between categories (political affiliation and religious affiliation are independent)

- There is a significant association between partyid and religious affiliation ($\chi^2$ = `r`)

- Religious affiliation (none/catholic) differed significantly between strong democrats and strong republicans...

- Proportions of people identifying as either atheist or Catholic differed significantly for Strong Republicans or Strong Democrats...
